# Decisions

Incremental decisions made during construction. For foundational architectural decisions (D1–D8), see the [Briefing](briefing.md).

### 2026-04-13 — Identity as layers, not a single column

The `users` table doesn't store identity. A separate `identity` table stores layers (`user_id`, `layer`, `key`, `content`). System prompt composed at runtime by joining layers.

**Why:** preserves the structured model from the POC (self/soul, ego/identity, ego/behavior). Each layer editable independently. Migration is layer-by-layer. Future layers (personas, knowledge, journeys) follow the same pattern.

**Supersedes:** briefing D5 originally described identity as a single TEXT column in `users`.

### 2026-04-13 — Design docs named by roadmap code

Design files follow the convention `<roadmap-code>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `cv0-m1-tracer-bullet.md`). Links the spec directly to the milestone it describes.

**Why:** as more milestones get specs, the naming makes the relationship explicit without needing a lookup.

### 2026-04-13 — POC Mirror as migration source, not just reference

The admin CLI includes `identity import --from-poc` to read layers directly from `~/.espelho/memoria.db`. New users get starter templates via `user add`.

**Why:** two onboarding paths from day one — migration for existing users, templates for new ones. Reduces friction for both.

---

### 2026-04-13 — Self-construction layer isolated from core

The mirror will be able to program itself (create tools, tables, logic) to serve each user's specific needs. This generated layer is strictly sandboxed — it cannot touch the core (identity, auth, sessions, agent runtime).

**Why:** the mirror needs to be genuinely useful for diverse needs (inventory, finances, social media) without becoming a monolith. Isolation protects stability while enabling unlimited per-user growth.
