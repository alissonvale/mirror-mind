# Worklog

What was done, what's next. Updated each session.

Current focus: **[CV0.E2 — Web Experience](../project/roadmap/cv0-foundation/cv0-e2-web-experience/)** `v0.4.0` → `v0.5.0`

---

## Next

S9 shipped and validated. Next candidates from CV0.E2: S8 (Memory Workspace), S10 (empty states), S7 (who's logged in). Or start the release cycle for v0.5.0 bundling S9 (and whichever of S7/S8/S10 land together).

## Done

### 2026-04-17 — S9 Context Rail ✅

Right-side panel on the chat page that shows Attention Memory made visible. Implementation + validation + review pass completed in one session.

- Server helpers: [`session-stats.ts`](../../server/session-stats.ts) approximates tokens and derives BRL cost; [`composed-snapshot.ts`](../../server/composed-snapshot.ts) lists layers + persona that entered the prompt; [`personas.ts`](../../server/personas.ts) holds the shared descriptor extractor used by reception and the rail.
- Web adapter: [`context-rail.tsx`](../../adapters/web/pages/context-rail.tsx) is the component; the SSE `/chat/stream` done event ships a full `rail` payload on every turn.
- Tests: [`tests/session-stats.test.ts`](../../tests/session-stats.test.ts) (6 unit tests) + 5 rail route tests appended to `tests/web.test.ts`. 79 passing total.
- Story docs: [plan](../project/roadmap/cv0-foundation/cv0-e2-web-experience/cv0-e2-s9-context-rail/plan.md) · [test guide](../project/roadmap/cv0-foundation/cv0-e2-web-experience/cv0-e2-s9-context-rail/test-guide.md) · [refactoring log](../project/roadmap/cv0-foundation/cv0-e2-web-experience/cv0-e2-s9-context-rail/refactoring.md).
- Process update: the development guide now describes the **Review pass** (step 5) as an explicit story lifecycle phase, with order, rhythm, and heuristics drawn from this session.

Follow-up task registered: split `adapters/web/index.tsx` into route modules (chat, admin, rail) when capacity allows.

### 2026-04-17 — CV0.E2 scope expanded + memory taxonomy adopted

Design session with the product-designer persona. Outcomes:

- **Reframed CV0.E2.** The web client is not a chat + admin page — it's the surface where the mirror's memory becomes legible. Two complementary surfaces: the rail (live Attention) and the Memory Workspace (durable memory).
- **Queued three new stories:** S9 Context Rail (attention memory visible), S8 Memory Workspace (cards per layer), S10 Empty states as invitations. S9 ordered before S8 so the rail teaches what signals matter.
- **Adopted a two-axis memory taxonomy** in [`docs/product/memory-taxonomy.md`](../product/memory-taxonomy.md). Seven cognitive roles (Attention, Identity, Episodic, Procedural, Semantic, Prospective, Reflexive) × six storage mechanisms (Identity layers, Episodic entries, Records, Attachments, Semantic index, KV). Cognitive axis credited to a conceptual conversation with Henrique Bastos.
- **Key decisions logged** (see [decisions.md](../project/decisions.md)): rail reflects composition not reception decisions; no soul/ego summary always visible; activity trail per-message discarded; KV scope strictly limited to pointers and ephemeral state.
- **Radar updated:** reception as multi-signal router, Prospective memory epic for CV3.

No code changed this session — docs and direction only.
