# Worklog

What was done, what's next. Updated each session.

Current focus: **[CV0.E2 — Web Experience](../project/roadmap/cv0-foundation/cv0-e2-web-experience/)** `v0.4.0` → `v0.5.0`

---

## Next

**S9 — Context Rail** is the next story. Plan is in [`cv0-e2-s9-context-rail/plan.md`](../project/roadmap/cv0-foundation/cv0-e2-web-experience/cv0-e2-s9-context-rail/plan.md). After S9: S8 (Memory Workspace) and S10 (empty states).

## Done

### 2026-04-17 — CV0.E2 scope expanded + memory taxonomy adopted

Design session with the product-designer persona. Outcomes:

- **Reframed CV0.E2.** The web client is not a chat + admin page — it's the surface where the mirror's memory becomes legible. Two complementary surfaces: the rail (live Attention) and the Memory Workspace (durable memory).
- **Queued three new stories:** S9 Context Rail (attention memory visible), S8 Memory Workspace (cards per layer), S10 Empty states as invitations. S9 ordered before S8 so the rail teaches what signals matter.
- **Adopted a two-axis memory taxonomy** in [`docs/product/memory-taxonomy.md`](../product/memory-taxonomy.md). Seven cognitive roles (Attention, Identity, Episodic, Procedural, Semantic, Prospective, Reflexive) × six storage mechanisms (Identity layers, Episodic entries, Records, Attachments, Semantic index, KV). Cognitive axis credited to a conceptual conversation with Henrique Bastos.
- **Key decisions logged** (see [decisions.md](../project/decisions.md)): rail reflects composition not reception decisions; no soul/ego summary always visible; activity trail per-message discarded; KV scope strictly limited to pointers and ephemeral state.
- **Radar updated:** reception as multi-signal router, Prospective memory epic for CV3.

No code changed this session — docs and direction only.
